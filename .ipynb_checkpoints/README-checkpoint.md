## Coupon Acceptance By Drivers 

Jupyter Notebook - [Coupon_Acceptance_Analysis](https://github.com/shruti0209/LearnML_PracticalApp1/blob/main/Coupon_Acceptance_Analysis.ipynb) 

**Findings:**

About All Coupons: 
1. Coupon acceptance rate is 57% across all coupon types
2. Coffee coupons are more offered and expensive restaurant coupons are least offered to drivers


About Bar Coupons: 
1. Bar coupons acceptance rate is 41%
2. Frequency of going to bar is most indicative of likeliness of acceptance of Bar coupon (travelers who go to bar less than once monthly are less likely to accept bar coupons) 
3. Those traveling with kids are less likely to accept bar coupons 
4. Unemployed drivers are more likely to accept bar coupons (acceptance rate of those who are unemployed is higher than the acceptance rates of employed drivers and students) 
5. There isn't significant difference in coupon acceptance rate by age of driver


About Coffee House Coupons: 
1. Coffee House coupon acceptance rate is 50%
2. Driving destination influences coffee coupon acceptance rate. Travelers going to no urgent destination have higher likelyhood of accepting coupons compared to those going to work or home
3. Those traveling with kids are less likely to accept coupons even when traveling to no urgent destination compared to those traveling alone or with adult co-passanger(s)  
4. Coffee coupon acceptance rate is highest at 10am and lower any other time of the day
5. However, **increasing coupon expiration to 1 day will likely get travelers to accept coffee coupons at times other than 10am**
6. Those with lower income (less than $50K) are more likely to accept coffee coupons
7. Similar to bar coupons, frequency of going to coffee house is most indicative of likeliness of acceptance of coffee coupons (travelers who go to coffee house less than once monthly are less likely to accept coffee coupons)
